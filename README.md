# timescaledb-with-toolkit-docker

Unofficial TimescaleDB Docker image with timescaledb-toolkit integrated.

## Motivation

Currently, the timescale/timescaledb official Docker images available on https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescaledb do not incorporate timescaledb-toolkit. However, the High Availability images provided by [timescale/timescaledb-ha](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescaledb-ha) do have the toolkit, but their excessive size makes them less suitable for development purposes and small installations.
